This folder should contain the following files: 
1. smpptest.cfg
2. smpp.jar
3. smpptest.jar
4. README

Make sure all the files are present in the same folder. 

Run the following command on your terminal to start SMPPClient simulator: 
	$ java -cp smpp.jar:smpptest.jar org.smpp.test.SMPPTest
For Benchmarking
        $ java -cp smpp.jar:smpptest.jar org.smpp.test.BenchMark

Follow the operations you need to perform once simulator is started by entering configuration values one by one

Enjoy !
